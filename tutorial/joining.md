# Joining the team
Joining the PHP Documentation team is a simple process, but a process nonetheless.
It can be summarized as:

## Write to a mailing list
Because official communication is done there, you should write to the proper list.
Say "Hi" and what you're interested in doing. You may feel more comfortable lurking
for a while, or reading the archives, but ultimately let the list know who you are.

### For authors
You should send your message to the `phpdoc@lists.php.net` mailing list. You
will need to subscribe to the list in order to send email to it.

### For translators
You should send your message to the appropriate `doc-{LANG}@lists.php.net` mailing list.

## Informal discussion
The mailing lists above are the primary communication forum. In particular,
decisions and plans should be made on the list so they are recorded in the
archives.

However for more realtime and/or informal chat, some doc authors hang out in
"Room 11" on Stackoverflow Chat: https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php

Some authors hang out in the `#php-doc` channel on IRC on the
https://Libera.Chat network, which is also bridged to the Discord server run
by the PHP Community Foundation, available at https://phpc.chat.

## Create a doc patch or three
This step is required to show us that you are a real human, you want to do
some work and in general know how to do this.

The simplest way to get started is by using GitHub, to create and send Pull Requests
to [php/doc-en][doc-en] or php/doc-{LANG} for translations.

Your Pull Requests will be then reviewed and accepted by someone with Git commit access.

## Obtaining Git commit access
If you plan to contribute to the manual regularly and want to help process
contributions from others, you might want to request to be added to the
documentation team (or a translation team) on GitHub, which you can do on the
email lists.

To be clear: you don't need Git commit access to start contributing to the
documentation! Anyone with a GitHub account (which is free) can submit Pull
Requests to the documentation repositories.

The next chapter will explain how to get the manual sources and how are they [structured](structure.php).
